# AJAX-User-Loader-
This is a web application demonstrating asynchronous user data retrieval using AJAX with jQuery. It features an HTML page with a button to load user data into a table. The button runs an AJAX request to the PHP script, and returns the data as a JSON response. The table is dynamically updated with user data without reloading the page.
